  <summary>A powerful Amiga Emulator, based on UAE</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
        This is a version of UAE, the Ubiquitous Amiga Emulator, with an
        emulation core largely based on WinUAE. It attempts to bring many of
        the great features of WinUAE to non-Windows platforms. This version now
        finally has a name, E-UAE, since that's what everybody was calling it
        anyway. The 'E' can stand for anything you fancy. Experimental,
        extreme, exciting, egalitarian, eggplant, . . .
    </p>
    <p>
        E-UAE is open-source software and is made available under the terms of
        the GNU GPL. E-UAE is based on the work of dozens of contributors
        including Bernd Schmidt (the original author and maintainer of UAE),
        Bernie Meyer (the author of the x86 JIT compiler), Toni Wilen (the
        current maintainer of WinUAE), and many more.
    </p>
    <p>
        To make full use of E-UAE you will need access to an image of some
        version of the Amiga Kickstart ROM (although UAE does include a ROM
        emulation which may work with some old games). The Amiga Kickstart ROMs
        are copyrighted material and may not be freely distributed (so don't
        ask me for a copy). If you don't have an Amiga from which you can
        legally make a ROM image, a selection of ROM images are available for
        purchase online from Cloanto - publishers of the Amiga Forever
        distribution.
