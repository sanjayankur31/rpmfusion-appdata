  <summary>An old-school 2D platform game</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
        Frogatto is an action-adventure “platformer” game starring a certain
        green dude. We could get a bit loquacious describing the game here, but
        you’re better off looking at some pictures; they ought to give you a
        sense of what it’s all about.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although frogatto is finished and fully-playable, we’re planning some
        major additions to the game over the next few years.
