    <p>
        Snes9x is a portable, freeware Super Nintendo Entertainment System
        (SNES) emulator. It basically allows you to play most games designed
        for the SNES and Super Famicom Nintendo game systems on your PC or
        Workstation; which includes some real gems that were only ever released
        in Japan.

        Snes9x is a portable, freeware Super Nintendo Entertainment System
        Snes9x is the result of well over three years worth of part-time
        hacking, coding, recoding, debugging, divorce, etc. (just kidding about
        the divorce bit). Snes9x is coded in C++, with three assembler CPU
        emulation cores on the i386 Linux and Windows ports.
