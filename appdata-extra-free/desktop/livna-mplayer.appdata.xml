  <summary>GUI for MPlayer</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
        Player is a movie player which runs on many systems (see the
        documentation). It plays most MPEG/VOB, AVI, Ogg/OGM, VIVO,
        ASF/WMA/WMV, QT/MOV/MP4, RealMedia, Matroska, NUT, NuppelVideo, FLI,
        YUV4MPEG, FILM, RoQ, PVA files, supported by many native, XAnim, and
        Win32 DLL codecs. You can watch VideoCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, DivX 3/4/5,
        WMV and even H.264 movies.
    </p>

        Another great feature of MPlayer is the wide range of supported output
        drivers. It works with X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev, AAlib,
        DirectFB, but you can use GGI, SDL (and this way all their drivers),
        VESA (on every VESA compatible card, even without X11!) and some low
        level card-specific drivers (for Matrox, 3Dfx and ATI), too! Most of
        them support software or hardware scaling, so you can enjoy movies in
        fullscreen. MPlayer supports displaying through some hardware MPEG
        decoder boards, such as the Siemens DVB, DXR2 and DXR3/Hollywood+.

    <p>
        MPlayer has an onscreen display (OSD) for status information, nice big
        antialiased shaded subtitles and visual feedback for keyboard controls.
        European/ISO 8859-1,2 (Hungarian, English, Czech, etc), Cyrillic and
        Korean fonts are supported along with 12 subtitle formats (MicroDVD,
        SubRip, OGM, SubViewer, Sami, VPlayer, RT, SSA, AQTitle, JACOsub, PJS
        and our own: MPsub). DVD subtitles (SPU streams, VOBsub and Closed
        Captions) are supported as well.
