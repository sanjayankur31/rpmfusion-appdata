  <description>
    <p>
        DVD95 is a GNOME application to convert DVD9 to DVD5 (4.7 GB), AVI or
        PSP files. The user interface is aimed at being simple and elegant to
        use. DVD95 is free and open-source software licensed under the terms of
        the GNU GPL v2.
    </p>

    <p>
        The shrinking factor may be computed for best results, or an adaptive
        compression ratio method may be used. DVDs can be converted to a file
        tree or ISO file. Results can be played back through xine, VLC,
        mplayer, etc. Burning can be used with the support of third party
        software (K3B). DVD95 needs no additionnals packages, as an onboard
        version of vamps and dvdauthor are used, to be as fast as possible.
