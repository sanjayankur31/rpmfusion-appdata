        SMPlayer is a free media player for Windows and Linux with built-in
        codecs that can play virtually all video and audio formats. It doesn't
        need any external codecs. Just install SMPlayer and you'll be able to
        play all formats without the hassle to find and install codec packs.
    </p>

        One of the most interesting features of SMPlayer: it remembers the
        settings of all files you play. So you start to watch a movie but you
        have to leave... don't worry, when you open that movie again it will be
        resumed at the same point you left it, and with the same settings:
        audio track, subtitles, volume...
    </p>

        SMPlayer is a graphical user interface (GUI) for the award-winning
        MPlayer, which is capable of playing almost all known video and audio
        formats. But apart from providing access for the most common and useful
        options of MPlayer, SMPlayer adds other interesting features like the
        possibility to play Youtube videos or download subtitles.
