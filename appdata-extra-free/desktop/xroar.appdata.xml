  <summary>A Dragon 32, Dragon 64 and Tandy CoCo emulator</summary>
  <description>
      <p>
          XRoar is a Dragon emulator that runs on a wide variety of platforms.
          Due to hardware similarities, XRoar also emulates the Tandy Colour
          Computer (CoCo) models 1 &amp; 2. Some features are: XRoar was
          originally written to run on Solaris, Linux and the GP32 handheld.
          Later, it was ported to the Nintendo DS. Support has now been dropped
          for the GP32 and NDS as emulation accuracy, and thus the CPU
          requirement, has increased.
