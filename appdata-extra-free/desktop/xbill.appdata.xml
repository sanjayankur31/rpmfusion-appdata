         Ever get the feeling that nothing is going right? You're a sysadmin,
         and someone's trying to destroy your computers. The little people
         running around the screen are trying to infect your computers with
         Wingdows [TM], a virus cleverly designed to resemble a popular
         operating system. Additionally, some computers are connected with
         network cables. When one computer on a network becomes infected, a
         spark will be sent down the cable, and will infect the computer on the
         other end when it reaches there.

         That's the basic idea of the game. Pretty simple, but fun for a while,
         and definitely something to appreciate.

         XBill was mostly written during the summer of 1994 by Brian Wellington
         and Matias Duarte, and has gone through several revisions since. The
         current version is 2.1. New ideas are appreciated, and if they sound
         interesting enough, may be implemented. Especially if those new ideas
         include graphics.
