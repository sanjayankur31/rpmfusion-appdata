  <summary>A lightweight and simple GTK based DVD slide show creator</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
        Imagination is a lightweight and simple DVD slide show maker for Linux
        and FreeBSD written in C language and built with the GTK+2 toolkit. I
        noticed a lack of a user-friendly DVD slide show maker for GNU/Linux,
        so I started developing Imagination.

        True, there are some other GUIs which do the job, but they usually
        require a lot of dependencies to be installed first and often their
        interfaces are bloated. Imagination has been designed from the ground
        up to be fast, light and easy-to-use. It requires the ffmpeg encoder to
        produce the movie file and libsox to handle the audio. Yes you don't
        need any other third-party software, I like the KISS principle :).

        Imagination at present features 69 transition effects, random function
        to automatically set a random transition on all the selected slides,
        cut/copy/paste ability on the slides, Ken Burns ability, text on the
        slides with some text animations, ability to add an empty slide with a
        gradient editor and export of the slideshow as OGV Theora/Vorbis,
        widescreen FLV video and 3GP for mobile phones.
