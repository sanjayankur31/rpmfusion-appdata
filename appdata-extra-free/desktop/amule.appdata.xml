    <p>
        aMule stands for all-platform Mule.
    </p>
    <p>
        aMule is an eMule-like client for the eD2k and Kademlia networks,
        supporting multiple platforms.  Currently aMule (officially) supports a
        wide variety of platforms and operating systems, being compatible with
        more than 60 different hardware+OS configurations.  aMule is entirely
        free, its sourcecode released under the GPL just like eMule, and
        includes no adware or spyware as is often found in proprietary P2P
        applications.  aMule is built upon the wxWidgets (formerly wxWindows)
        toolkit, which enables it to support multiple platforms.
