  <summary>Multitrack audio editor</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
        Audacity is a free, easy-to-use, multi-track audio editor and recorder
        for Windows, Mac OS X, GNU/Linux and other operating systems. The
        interface is translated into many languages.  </p>
    <p>
        Audacity is free software, developed by a group of volunteers and
        distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Free software
        is not just free of cost (like "free beer"). It is free as in freedom
        (like "free speech"). Free software gives you the freedom to use a
        program, study how it works, improve it and share it with others. For
        more information, visit the Free Software Foundation.

    </p>
    <p>
        Programs like Audacity are also called open source software, because
        their source code is available for anyone to study or use. There are
        thousands of other free and open source programs, including the Firefox
        web browser, the LibreOffice or Apache OpenOffice office suites and
        entire Linux-based operating systems such as Ubuntu.  </p>
