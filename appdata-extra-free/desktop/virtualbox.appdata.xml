            VirtualBox is a cross-platform virtualization application. What does
            that mean? For one thing, it installs on your existing Intel or
            AMD-based computers, whether they are running Windows, Mac, Linux or
            Solaris operating systems. Secondly, it extends the capabilities of
            your existing computer so that it can run multiple operating systems
            (inside multiple virtual machines) at the same time. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So, for example, you can run Windows and Linux on your Mac, run
            Windows Server 2008 on your Linux server, run Linux on your Windows
            PC, and so on, all alongside your existing applications. You can
            install and run as many virtual machines as you like -- the only
            practical limits are disk space and memory.

            VirtualBox is a cross-platform virtualization application. What does
            VirtualBox is deceptively simple yet also very powerful. It can run
            everywhere from small embedded systems or desktop class machines all
            the way up to datacenter deployments and even Cloud environments.
