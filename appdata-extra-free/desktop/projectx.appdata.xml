    <p>
        European digital radio &amp; television uses the DVB standard to
        broadcast its data. Project-X gives you a look behind the transmissions
        and tries its best to handle &amp; repair many stream types and shows
        what went wrong on reception. It's not meant for a regular use but for
        test and learning conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the moment, Project-X does not include support for H.264 (HD video)
        content.
