      <p>
          FakeNES is a highly portable, Open Source NES and Famicom emulator.
      </p>

      <p>
          It runs on all modern operating systems (such as Windows, Linux, and
          Mac) and has an actively maintained DOS port for enthusiasts. Support
          for phones and other mobile platforms is under development.
      </p>

      <p>
          Originally created in 2001 by a rag-tag team of developers from
          projects such as ZSNES, after ten years of sporadic development it
          has been forked by Digital Carat Group and almost completely
          rewritten. It has also been renamed to FakeNES GT, meaning "Good
          Times", to distinguish it from the original project.
