        MPV is a fork of mplayer2 and MPlayer. It shares some features with the
        former projects while introducing many more.
    </p>
    <p>
        Streamlined CLI options:  MPlayer's options parser was improved to
        behave more like other CLI programs, and many option names and
        semantics were reworked to make them more intuitive and memorable.

        On Screen Controller: While mpv has no official GUI, it has a small
        controller that is triggered by mouse movement.

        High quality video output: mpv has a OpenGL based video output that is
        capable of many features loved by videophiles, such as video scaling
        with popular high quality algorithms, color management, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
        GPU video decoding: mpv leverages the FFmpeg hwaccel APIs to support
        VDPAU, VAAPI, DXVA2 and VDA video decode acceleration.

        Active development: mpv is under active development, focusing on code
        refactoring and cleanups as well as adding features. Want a feature?
        Post a patch or request it!
