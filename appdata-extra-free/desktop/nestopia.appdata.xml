  <summary>A portable open source NES/Famicom emulator</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
        Nestopia is a portable open source NES/Famicom emulator written in C++.
        It's designed to be as accurate as possible and supports a large number
        of peripherals. The hardware is emulated at cycle-by-cycle granularity,
        ensuring full support for software that do mid-scanline and other
        timing trickery.
