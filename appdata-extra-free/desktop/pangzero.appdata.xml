  <summary>A clone and enhancement of Super Pang</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
         Pang Zero is a clone and enhancement of Super Pang, a fast-paced
         action game that involves popping balloons with a harpoon.
    </p>
    <p>
         The intention of our effort is to create a fun, open-source game that
         many (currently up to 6) people can play together. The game is
         playable, you can try it now. It's free, we made it because we like to
         share the fun. You can play Pang Zero alone, but it's a lot more fun
         to play with your friends.
     </p>
