        <p>
            Traverso Digital Audio Workstation is a cross platform multitrack audio
            recording  and editing suite, with an innovative and easy to master User
            Interface. It's suited for both the professional and home user, who needs a
            robust and solid DAW.
        </p>
        <p>
            Traverso is a complete solution from recording to CD Mastering. By supplying
            many common tools in one package, you don't have to learn how to use lots of
            applications with different user interfaces. This considerably lowers the
            learning curve, letting you get your audio processing work done faster!
        </p>
        <p>
            A unique approach to non-linear audio processing was developed for Traverso to
            provide extremely solid and robust audio processing and editing. Adding and
            removal of effects plugins, moving Audio Clips and creating new Tracks during
            playback are all perfectly safe, giving you instant feedback on your work!
