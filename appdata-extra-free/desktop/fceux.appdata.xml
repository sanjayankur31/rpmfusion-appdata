  <summary>A cross platform, NTSC and PAL Famicom/NES emulator</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
        FCEUX is a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), Famicom, and Famicom
        Disk System (FDS) emulator. It supports both PAL (European) and NTSC
        (USA/JPN) modes. It supports both Windows and SDL versions for cross
        compatibility.
    </p>

    <p>
        The FCEUX concept is that of an "all in one" emulator that offers
        accurate emulation and the best options for both casual play and a
        variety of more advanced emulator functions. For pro users, FCEUX
        offers tools for debugging, rom-hacking, map making, Tool-assisted
        movies, and Lua scripting.
    </p>

    <p>
        FCEUX is an evolution of the original FCE Ultra emulator. Over time FCE
        Ultra had separated into many distinct branches.
        The concept behind FCEUX is to merge elements from FCEU Ultra, FCEU
        rerecording, FCEUXD, FCEUXDSP, FCEUXDSP CE, and FCEU-mm into a single
        branch of FCEU.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the X implies, it is an all-encompassing version of the FCEU
        emulator that provides the best of all worlds for the general player,
        the ROM-hacking community, and the Tool-Assisted Speedrun Community.
