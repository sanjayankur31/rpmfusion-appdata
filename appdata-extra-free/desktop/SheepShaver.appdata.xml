    <summary>An open source PowerMac emulator</summary>
    <description>
        <p>
            SheepShaver is a MacOS run-time environment for BeOS and Linux that
            allows you to run classic MacOS applications inside the BeOS/Linux
            multitasking environment. This means that both BeOS/Linux and MacOS
            applications can run at the same time (usually in a window on the
            BeOS/Linux desktop) and data can be exchanged between them. If you are
            using a PowerPC-based system, applications will run at native speed
            (i.e. with no emulation involved). There is also a built-in PowerPC
            emulator for non-PowerPC systems.
        </p>

        <p>
            SheepShaver is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public
            License (GPL). However, you still need a copy of MacOS and a PowerMac
            ROM image to use SheepShaver. If you're planning to run SheepShaver on
            a PowerMac, you probably already have these two items.
