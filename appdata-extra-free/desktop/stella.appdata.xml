  <summary>A multi-platform Atari 2600 Video Computer System emulator</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
        The Atari 2600 Video Computer System (VCS), introduced in 1977, was the
        most popular home video game system of the early 1980's.  Now you can
        enjoy all of your favorite Atari 2600 games on your PC thanks to
        Stella!
    </p>

    <p>
        Stella is a multi-platform Atari 2600 VCS emulator released under the
        GNU General Public License (GPL). Stella was originally developed for
        Linux by Bradford W. Mott, and is currently maintained by Stephen
        Anthony. Since its original release several people have joined the
        development team to port Stella to other operating systems such as
        AcornOS, AmigaOS, DOS, FreeBSD, IRIX, Linux, OS/2, MacOS, Unix, and
        Windows. The development team is working hard to perfect the emulator
        and we hope you enjoy our effort.
