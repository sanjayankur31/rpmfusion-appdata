            You control a gnome, who can walk around a garden, along paths  already marked,
            or  create  new paths wherever you wish. You also have a ball, which can be
            thrown in the direction you're facing, towards the gnome's feet.  Points  are
            scored for collecting cherries (if you collect eight cherries without stopping
            or  pushing  an  apple,  you  get  a  bonus), killing monsters (by squashing
            them, or throwing the ball at them), and collecting the prize left when all the
            monsters have come out of  their den.
