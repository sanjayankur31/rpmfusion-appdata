    <summary>GTK GUI for VBA-M, a high compatibility Gameboy Advance Emulator</summary>
    <description>
        <p>
            This package provides the GTK GUI version of VisualBoyAdvance-M.
            VisualBoyAdvance-M is a Nintendo Game Boy Emulator with high
            compatibility with commercial games. It emulates the Nintendo Game
            Boy Advance hand held console, in addition to the original Game Boy
            hand held systems and its Super and Color variants. VBA-M is a
            continued development of the now inactive VisualBoy Advance
            project, with many improvements from various developments of VBA.
